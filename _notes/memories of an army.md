title: Memories of an ARMY
---

To celebrate my 2+ years of being an ARMY, I thought I’d go on a trip down memory lane and write about some of my favourite BTS moments.

### Feb 2020: The making of an ARMY

It was only a few weeks shy before the WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic that I became an ARMY. This was shortly after BTS just released their _Map of the Soul:7_ album. I don’t remember the exact date I became an ARMY, but I think it’s sometime after [_ON Kinetic Manifesto_ _Film: Come Prima_ MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwMa6gpoE9I "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwMa6gpoE9I") and before [_Black Swan_ MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lapF4DQPKQ "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lapF4DQPKQ") was released.

My first glimpse into BTS was a YouTube video of them on _The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon_ – possibly, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4mmfzFazoI "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4mmfzFazoI")? I can’t remember. I read a lot of articles and watched a number of videos trying to learn about their history and each member. It wasn’t until I stumbled across [RM’s speech at the 2018 United Nations General Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg") that I decided to become a fan and support them for good.

### Apr 2020: Bang Bang Con

More than 5+ hours free live streaming of BTS’ previous concerts and Musters over 2 days at [Bang Bang Con: The Live](https://bts.fandom.com/wiki/Bang_Bang_Con_The_Live#:~:text=Bang%20Bang%20Con%20The%20Live%20(stylized%20as%20BANG%20BANG%20CON,a%20total%20of%20107%20regions. "https://bts.fandom.com/wiki/Bang_Bang_Con_The_Live#:~:text=Bang%20Bang%20Con%20The%20Live%20(stylized%20as%20BANG%20BANG%20CON,a%20total%20of%20107%20regions.") event – Yay! As a new fan, it was a great way to get to know them through their performances, and to discover the range of songs from their extensive discography.

I loved seeing some of their older performances such as _The Red Bullet_ and _Wings Tour_, but my favourite concert was the _BTS World Tour: Love Yourself in Seoul_. They sure know how to put on a great show.

### Aug 2020: First ever comeback

My very first BTS comeback. It’s funny, but a few hours before [_Dynamite_ MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg") premiered on YouTube, I felt fatigued, and became bedridden all of a sudden. It was a scary experience. (Side note: I was trying out a vegetarian diet for a week, and my body was unable to cope with the new change). I slept for a bit, and woke up just in time before the premiere. The high energy of _Dynamite_ was so infectious that I bounced back to better health not long afterwards. It was nice to celebrate the [record-breaking premiere](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2020/9/bts-smash-youtube-viewing-records-once-again-with-single-dynamite-628998 "https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2020/9/bts-smash-youtube-viewing-records-once-again-with-single-dynamite-628998") with other ARMY on social media later that evening.

### Oct 2020: Map of the Soul ON:E – First ever (online) concert experience

My very first BTS live concert was [Map of the Soul ON:E](https://bts.fandom.com/wiki/Map_of_the_Soul_ON:E) – aired online, of course. I bought the two-day pass, and I loved it so much that I watched both replays. It made me think, if this online concert was _that_ good, then I can’t even imagine how good their live audience concerts must be. I’m a [Map of the Soul: 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_of_the_Soul:_7 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_of_the_Soul:_7") era ARMY, so seeing them perform those songs felt particularly special to me.

### Nov 2020: Life Goes On

[BE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_(BTS_album) "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_(BTS_album)") – another highly anticipated comeback. This time it’s a full album and I loved how BTS had more input with the production process. I loved the concept, and _[Life Goes On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N-Fsa9Evo0 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N-Fsa9Evo0")_ is such a comforting and healing track that captures how the world changed in 2020 because of the pandemic, and no matter what, life will go on.

### Feb 2021: One Year ARMY anniversary

BTS MTV Unplugged Performances. Every performance was stellar. And, oh my goodness – [they performed a cover Coldplay’s Fix You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFTuGsj6Hpk "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFTuGsj6Hpk"), too. Also, it’s my one year ARMY anniversary!

### Mar 2021: Grammy Award Nominations

BTS at the Grammy Awards. Even though the group were nominated for best Pop Duo/Group Performance category but [didn’t win](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2021/03/15/the-grammys-once-again-did-the-bare-minimum-for-bts/?sh=368899c96129 "https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2021/03/15/the-grammys-once-again-did-the-bare-minimum-for-bts/?sh=368899c96129"), they’re still winners in my eyes.
