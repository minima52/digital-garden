It’s been 1.5 years since I started self-studying Korean, and I’m surprised how many vocabulary and grammar points I already know. I think this has to do with having some prior exposure to the language, which I’d gained from listening to Korean music and watching Korean dramas for many number of years.

As a university student, I enjoyed listening to Korean pop music, such as ballads, hip hop, and bubblegum pop. I remember not being able to understand much Korean back then, so I struggled when it came to navigating song titles that was only written in 한굴 (_Hangeul_). _Hangeul_ is the official writing script in Korea created by King Sejong the Great in 1443. For most learners, it’s the first and crucial stepping stone into learning and understanding the language. My main problem was that I found it difficult distinguishing between song titles and remembering which songs I liked on an album. What I ended doing instead was by referring to each song by a generic track number, such as ‘Track 3’ or ‘Track 9’ instead of the actual title. In hindsight, I think I did the artist a disservice to their song(s), and that didn’t sit well with me.

I had the option of romanisation, which is a ‘simplified’ way of reading Korean words, but in Roman (Latin) script. This is a good short term fix for those who have not learned how to read _Hangeul_ yet, but [it’s a flawed system](https://studiousbees.tumblr.com/post/164878389202/why-i-dont-like-romanization-and-vocab-lists) when it comes to pronunciation. Billy from Go Billy Korean explains it very well in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2jPpO7VG5k).

I didn’t enjoy romanisation myself. Not only was it difficult to read, it didn’t look aesthetically pleasing. Instead, I decided to go online and learn how to read and write _Hangeul_ myself. Surprisingly, it only took me a few hours to learn the written script. You can even learn it [within 30 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85qJXvyFrIc)! While I couldn’t understand what the title of a song was about without finding an English translation, I was still able to identify one song title from another. Problem solved!

Speaking of music, I think it’s one of the easiest ways to get your ears used to the sounds of a language. However, I personally find visual content much more effective in understanding the subtleties of a language. When I listen to a piece of music, I often find that I get carried away by the melody. But when I watch a show instead, I pick up on pitch, tone, body language, and of course, plenty of vocabulary.

Now, more than a decade later, I still surprise myself at the number of vocabulary and grammar I managed to accumulate over the years just from exposing myself to the language early on. I think this has made my beginner Korean learning experience in the past few months a familiar and enjoyable one so far, and I can’t recommend it enough for all language learners out there.
