This is my [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, which is a quick summary of the things that currently plague my monkey mind. You should create one too.

### How I’m spending my time

-   [Reading](https://www.maytrinh.me/book-list/) widely. Lately, I’ve been reading about personal finance.
-   Writing atomic notes in Obsidian and linking my thinking.

### What I’m thinking about

-   French Impressionist Art especially Monet.
-   Gee, it’s already the end of 2022.

### New discoveries

-   Purchased my first Traveller’s Notebook, where it will become my 2023 planner. I love how customisable it is.
-   Jazz piano music. I love love love how classy it is.
