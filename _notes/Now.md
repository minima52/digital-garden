This is my now page, which is a list of things that currently plague my monkey mind. What's a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>, and why you should create one.

### How I’m spending my time
- Reading widely. Lately, I’ve been reading about personal finance.
- Writing atomic notes in Obsidian and linking my thinking.

### What I’m thinking about
- French Impressionist Art especially Monet.
- Gee, it’s already the end of 2022.

### New discoveries
- Purchased my first Traveller’s Notebook, where it will become my 2023 planner. I love how customisable it is.
- Jazz piano music. I love love love how classy it is.
