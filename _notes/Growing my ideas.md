title: Growing my ideas
---

In his book, _[How to Steal Like an Artist](https://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253)_, Kleon says you are only as good as your last post. Blog entries in particular are typically organised in a chronological order, which means that the latest entries are at the top of the feed and the earliest entries are at the bottom. What I think he means is that your readers can only gather as much about you based from your latest blog entries.

### Blogs

I find that that blog entries are typically written once, and don’t cater for the same amount of reflection and connection of ideas that other forms such as digital gardens provide.

As someone who struggled to maintain a blog many times in the past, I find this idea eye-opening. Most blogs are typically organised by chronological order, and I felt that if I didn’t record something now, then I could miss that chance to do it in the future. This was stressful for me as it forced me to try and put something substantial out. When it came time for me to write about something, I never knew what to write and that frustrated me. I’m a bit of a perfectionist too, but I digress.

### Digital Gardens

I’ve only come across digital gardens and the idea of learning in public recently but it’s a concept that’s promising to me as someone who likes to dwell on things a bit, but I don’t make a conscious effort to capture or retain that information. Most of the time my thoughts are half-baked, but have the potential to become a solid idea. The great thing about a digital garden is that it evolves with you just as how your thought process changes based on the ideas that you read or hear about. I like how I can go back and tend to that thought again and see it flourish after I’ve given it some time to ‘incubate’. It’s also interesting to see how my thought process has changed, and this is exciting as far as personal development goes!

### Ending notes

I love the idea of a digital garden, and while I still find blogs a little restrictive for expressing my thoughts, still utilise them on my website as a way to ‘update’ myself and my readers on what I’m up to. When I have a thought that I think has the potential to be a full-fledge idea, I think that’s when I will turn to digital gardens as way to grow my ideas.

I find that the more I write, the more my thinking process starts to deepen. I often have many thoughts on my mind, and instead of keeping them to myself, I now like to share my thoughts and ideas with others, and develop the habit of thinking in public.

As someone who considers myself a perfectionist, I’m the type of person who’s afraid of showing my work until it’s final. Sometimes, this could be later or never at all. Having this mentality stopped me from achieving many great things I hoped to achieve, but that’s for another post.

I find writing to be an excellent form of creative expression. It’s also therapeutic, too. My writing isn’t perfect, and I have a long way to go. But so far, I’m loving the challenge of learning how to become a better writer.
