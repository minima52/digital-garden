RM's second solo work *Indigo* is coming out this Friday, and I'm excited to hear his new work.

In anticipation *Indigo*, I thought I resurrect and renew a post I had written on 18 January 2021 about *seoul*, one of the tracks on *mono*, RM's first mixtape.

The song brings back memories of my one week trip to Seoul in 2014 with friends where we walked along the ashy streets of Seoul, explored Cheonggyecheon, and cycled along the Han River. 

Even though the song is clearly about Namjoon's sentiments of Seoul, I find it interesting how I can relate to it on a personal level when I think back to my home city, Sydney - my birthplace that's now become an extension of myself. 

I love the smell of coffee that comes from the hole in the wall cafes in Surry Hills. I love the slight rattle of a Sydney City train as it crosses the Harbour Bridge on an overcast day. But there are times too, when I'm sick of it, because it's become all too familiar.
