Fourteen Suns & Moons Ago –

Like A Ghostly Visitor Of The Night,

You, Who Had Crept In Silently With Grace,

Nestled Yourself Underneath A Universe Of Stars.

Upon The Wake Of Daylight, 

You, Who Gazed Out From The Window At The World Spinning Outside,

Awakened To A Sentimental Soul Inside.

II

Your Cape Of Soft Black Fur Laced With The Most Subtle Shade Of Ivory, 

Was Darker And More Mysterious Than Nightfall.

Your Deep Purr Likened To The Roll Of A Distant Thunder,

Quietened Even The Roughest Of Seas.

Like The Waxing And Waning Of The Fluorescent Moon,

Your Feline Eyes, Wild And Enigmatic,

Were Enough To Lull The Evening Stars To Sleep.

III

Fourteen Suns & Moons Ago,

Fate Came And Warmly Wrapped Her Arms Around You, 

And Like An Old Acquaintance, Bade You Farewell: Adieu!

You, Who Once Dreamed Many Dreams Underneath A Universe Of Stars, 

Vanished Off Into The Cathartic Rain To A Faraway But Familiar Place,

Leaving Behind Only A Ghostly Trace Of A Memory,

Of What Once Was.
