This is my now page, which is a list of things that currently plague my monkey mind. What's a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>, and why you should create one.

### How Iâ€™m spending my time:
- Reading widely. Lately, Iâ€™ve been reading about personal finance. I think it's an area where there's still a lot of gaps to fill particularly, how interest rates work, and how best to pay off mortgages faster.
- Writing atomic notes in Obsidian and linking my thinking.

### What Iâ€™m thinking about:
- French Impressionist Art especially Monet. After returning from a trip to Melbourne and seeing the Monet & Friends exhibition, I started becoming interested in Impressionism. Currently reading the book, *Impressionism* by Karin H. Grimme.
- Gee, itâ€™s already the end of 2022. ðŸ¥²

### New discoveries:
- Purchased my first Travellerâ€™s Notebook, where it will become my 2023 planner. I love how customisable it is.
- Jazz piano music. I love love love how classy it is.
