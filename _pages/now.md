<b>NOW</b>

<small>Last updated: Monday, 05 Dec 2022, 08:54AM</small>

This is my now page, which is a list of things that currently plague my monkey mind. What's a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>, and why you should create one.

Here's how I’m spending my time:
- Reading *Impressionism* by Karin H. Grimme and *Autumn Light* by Pico Iyer.
- Writing atomic notes in Obsidian and linking my thinking.
- Updating this website. Moving it from Wordpress to a static website is probably the best decision I've made.

Here's what I’m thinking about:
- French Impressionist Art especially Monet. After returning from a trip to Melbourne and seeing the Monet & Friends exhibition, I started becoming interested in Impressionism. 
- RM's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRy8OYhLO-A">Indigo Magazine Film</a> interview. It's so interesting learning what inspires his creative process.
