<b>QUOTES</b>

A small collection of quotes in no particular order.

> "Our tomorrow may be dark, painful, difficult. We might stumble or fall down, but stars shine brightest when the night is the darkest. If the stars are hidden we'll let moonlight guide us. If even the moon is dark, let our faces be the light that helps us find our way." 
>
> -- Kim Nam-jun, BTS


> On a warm spring day, a galloping horse was only too clearly a sweating animal of flesh and blood. But a horse racing through a snowstorm became one with the very elements; wrapped in the whirling blast of the north wind, the beast embodied the icy breath of winter.
>
> -- Yukio Mishima, *Spring Snow*
