### About



### Credits

Template: [Maxime's public template on Github](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)
Note-taking Program: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
Code Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Website Hosting: Dreamhost


This site was created using [Maxime's public template on Github](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) following his [instructions](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) to set it up with the *limited* programming knowledge in my arsenal (I did it! ðŸ˜…).

All my writing is served on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I used [Mike's guide](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow) to utilise Visual Studio Code editor to commit the files to this website.

This site is hosted by Dreamhost.
