# FAQ

## How do I navigate this site?

## Credits

This site was made using [Maxime's public template on Github](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) following his [instructions](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) to set it up. All my writing is served on Obsidian. I used [Mike's guide](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow) to utilise Visual Studio Code to commit the files to this website.
