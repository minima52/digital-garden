### About



### Credits

This site was created using [Maxime's public template on Github](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) following his [instructions](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) to set it up with the *limited* programming knowledge in my arsenal (I did it! ðŸ˜…).

All my writing is served on Obsidian. I used [Mike's guide](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow) to utilise Visual Studio Code to commit the files to this website.

This site is hosted by Dreamhost.

*In progress*
