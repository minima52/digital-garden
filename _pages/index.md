# This is a collection of my notes.

<p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm May. Iâ€™m a deep thinker and I often have many thoughts on my mind that Iâ€™ll try to share here. You can think of it like a digital garden, made up of atomic notes on various topics that interests me. 

The notes I write are mostly for myself, however you are free to explore them as you like by clicking on any link that interests you. Some notes of interest: [[BTS]], [[Language Learning]], and [[Thoughts]].</p>


<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  I also like to read and often record what Iâ€™ve read in a year in my [[library]]. I write [[poetry]] from time to time. 
  Here are a list of [[tools]] I use, and what I'm up to [[now]]. [[Archive]]
