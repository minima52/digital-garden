# This is a collection of notes

<p>Hi! 👋 I'm May. You've stumbled upon a collection of notes that contain everything from musings, streams of consciousness to thoughts I have been incubating for awhile. Grab a cup of coffee or tea, and make yourself at home. ☕️

I’m a deep thinker and I often have many thoughts on my mind that I’ll try to share here. This is a digital garden, which is somewhat similar to a personal wiki that's made up of atomic notes on various topics that interests me. The notes I write are mostly for myself, however you are free to explore them as you like by clicking on any link that interests you. Here are a list of [[tools]] I use. </p>
