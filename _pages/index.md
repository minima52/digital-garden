<p>Hi! 👋 I'm May. You've stumbled upon a collection of notes that contain everything from musings, streams of consciousness to thoughts that have been incubating in my mind for awhile. 🧠✨ </p>

<p>The notes I write are mostly for myself and for the most part a work-in-progress so expect some wild flowers along your walk through my <a class="internal-link" href="/notes/growing my ideas.md">digital garden</a>. Feel free to explore them as you like by clicking on any link that interests you. </p>
