# This is a collection of my notes.

<p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm May. Iâ€™m a deep thinker and I often have many thoughts on my mind that Iâ€™ll try to share here. This is a digital garden, which is somewhat similar to a personal wiki that's made up of atomic notes on various topics that interests me. The notes I write are mostly for myself, however you are free to explore them as you like by clicking on any link that interests you. Here are a list of [[tools]] I use. </p>
