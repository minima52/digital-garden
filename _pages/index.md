# This is a collection of my notes.

<p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm May. Iâ€™m a deep thinker and I often have many thoughts on my mind that Iâ€™ll try to share here. My writings are mostly for myself, but you are free to explore as you like by clicking on any link that interests you. Some notes of interest: [[BTS]], [[Language Learning]], and [[Notes]].</p>



<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  I also like to read and often record what Iâ€™ve read in a year in my [[library]]. I write [[poetry]] from time to time. 
  Here are a list of [[tools]] I use, and what I'm up to [[now]]. 
  See all the latest updates in the [[changelog]].
