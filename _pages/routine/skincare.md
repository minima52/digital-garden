<b>SKINCARE ROUTINE</b>

I am in my 30s, and it's important that I maintain a regular skincare routine day and night as I wish to age well. My skin type is dry/sensitive with a bit of redness around my t-zone. My goal is to have healthy looking skin that's firm, hydrated, and free of visible signs of aging. 

### Morning

- Cleanser: Cerave cleanser
- Toner: Innisfree Green Tea Balancing Skin Ex
- Serum: Innisfree Green Tea Freshly Squeezed Serum
- Eye cream: Benton Fermentation Eye Cream
- Moisturiser: Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream
- Sunscreen: Ultra Violet SPF 50+ Sunscreen


### Evening

My evening routine is similar to my morning one, except that I remove my make up prior to doing my evening skincare routine. No matter how late I return home or how tired I am, I always remove my make up as part of a healthy skin regimen. I also use a retinol at night.

- Make up remover: Heimish Make Up Remover Balm
- Make up wipes: Johnson & Johnson Daily Essentials Night Pampering Facial Cleansing Wipes
- Cleanser: Cerave cleanser
- Toner: Innisfree Green Tea Balancing Skin Ex
- Retinol: Innisfree Retinol Cica Repair Ampoule
- Serum: Innisfree Black Green Tea Ampoule or Kiehls Midnight Recovery Concentrate Oil
- Eye cream: Benton Fermentation Eye Cream
- Moisturiser: Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream
