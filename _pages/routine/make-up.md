<b>MAKE UP ROUTINE</b>

I apply make up every time I go to work, to meet up with friends when I head out, or at family functions and events. Otherwise, I'm barefaced most of the time. ðŸ‘¶ My make up routine tends to be simple with focus placed around the eyes. Usually it takes me 20-25 mins to apply make up.

- Primer: Shiseido
- Foundation: Dior
  - I tend to use high end foundation over drug store ones as I like the long-lasting and lightweight formula.
- Eyebrow: Shu Uemura
- Eyelash curler: Shiseido
- Mascara: Clio
- Eyeliner: Stila
- Eyeshadow: Shiseido and Lancome and Innisfree
- Blush: Nars
- Setting powder: Innisfree and Hourglass
- Setting spray: Urban Decay
