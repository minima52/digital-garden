`/reading`

A list of books I’ve read. Visit my Goodreads account for a full collection of books I’ve read to date.

I try to read widely, however I tend to lean towards non-fiction books these days. Some of my favourite genres include: productivity, minimalism, learning, and general health.

★ = Personal recommendation
