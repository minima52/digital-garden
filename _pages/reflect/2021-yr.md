`/year in review (2021)`

What an eventful and difficult year 2021 has been. The pandemic was at its worst this year in Australia, and Sydney was just behind Melbourne in terms of case numbers. 

It was inevitable, but I was made redundant from my 7 year old job in April, but  was pleasantly surprised when I found a new job two months later. My managers postponed my start date to July due to the increasing severity of COVID in Sydney. I spent one whole month mostly studying Korean. When I started my new job, I did my training via Zoom during Sydney's first month of lockdown. 3 weeks later I started taking incoming calls and assisting guests and travel agents. It's always challenging navigating a new work environment, let alone when you are doing this all from home with no one around to directly supervise. But I survived. 

In retrospect, if I were to remember 2021, it will go down as the year of lockdowns.
