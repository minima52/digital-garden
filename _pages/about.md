<h1>About</h1>

Hi, I'm May! I like dark chocolate, bubbly champagne, sunsets on the beach, one-on-one conversations, Kyoto, cà phê sữa đá, morning sunlight, scenic walks and hikes, Susan Sontag’s essays, escargots à la bourguignonne, chai lattes, lazy Sundays, smooth jazz music and Haruki Murakami.

Here are some of my [[influences]] that have inspired me and shaped my worldviews.
