# About

I’m a deep thinker and I often have many thoughts on my mind that I’ll try to share here. My writings are mostly for myself, but you are free to explore as you like by clicking on any link that interests you.

I’m currently learning Korean and will share my language learning progress. In addition to that, I’m a passionate BTS fan, and will write about my experience as an ARMY, and how I’m learning to love and speak myself.

I also like to read and often record what I’ve read in a year. I write poetry from time to time, and share some of the photos I’ve taken.

Here’s what I’m up to these days, what my morning routine looks like, as well as what’s in my toolkit.

Hope you enjoy your stay!
