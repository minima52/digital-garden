<h1>Lessons</h1>

A reminder to myself of the lessons I have learned in life.

<br />

### Lifehacks

- If there is a trial version, give the product a try first before you buy.

<br />

### Health

- Meditate or journal after waking for clarity and a sense of calmness.

<br />

### Emotional Intelligence

- When someone says no, it does not mean they are rejecting you. It just means something is not acceptable for them.[^1]

<br />

### Learning

- Never underestimate the usefulness of a public library. 
- Use dead time (e.g. work commutes, waiting for public transport) to listen to podcast or read a book. Minimise scrolling mindlessly on social media.

<br />

### Productivity

- Working harder is not going to create more and better results. Work smarter by maximising efficiency.

<br />

### Relationships
