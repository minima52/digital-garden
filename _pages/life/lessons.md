<h1>Lessons</h1>

A reminder to myself of the lessons I have learned in life.

<h2>On Time</h2>

- Use dead time (e.g. work commutes, waiting for public transport) to listen to a podcast or read a book. Minimise scrolling mindlessly on social media.


<h2>Lifehacks</h2>

- If there is a trial version, give the product a try first before you buy.

<h2>On Rejection</h2>

- When someone says no, it does not mean they are rejecting you. It just means something is not acceptable for them.[^1]

<h2>On Learning</h2>

- Learning is not linear. Our brain does not think from sequentially from left to right or from top to bottom. 
- Never underestimate the usefulness of a public library. 

<h2>On Productivity</h2>

- Working harder is not going to create more and better results. Work smarter by maximising efficiency.

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h2>Health</h2>
