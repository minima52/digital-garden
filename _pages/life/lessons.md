<h1>Lessons</h1>

A reminder to myself of the lessons I have learned in life.

<br />

### Emotional Intelligence

- When someone says no, it does not mean they are rejecting you. It just means something is not acceptable for them.

### Health

- Meditate or journal after waking for clarity and a sense of calmness.

### Learning

- Never underestimate the usefulness of a public library. 

### Productivity

### Relationships
