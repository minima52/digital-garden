### Hong Kong (22.3193Â° N, 114.1694Â° E)

The second time I visited Hong Kong was with a group of friends in my mid-20s.<br />
The first time was when I visited my sister in 2012 when she was on exchange as a student.<br />
We had claypot rice, roast goose, milk tea.

### Seoul (37.5665Â° N, 126.9780Â° E)

I remember feeling excited when our flight landed in Incheon Airport.<br />
We stayed at a traditional hanok in Seoul. The host was delighful, making sure we were well fed each morning.<br />
On our final night she made us <i>tteokguk</i> (ë–¡êµ­), made up of sliced rice cakes in a broth, which I savoured every bite of it.<br />
We visited Bukchon Hanok Village, and rented a bike and cycled along the Han River. <br />
The food we had in Seoul was the best - mandu, bibim naengmyeon, fried chicken with <i>makgeolli</i>, gingseng chicken...
