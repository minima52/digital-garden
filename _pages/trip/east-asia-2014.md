### Hong Kong (22.3193Â° N, 114.1694Â° E)

The second time I visited Hong Kong was with a group of friends in my mid-20s. We had claypot rice, roast goose, milk tea.

### Seoul (37.5665Â° N, 126.9780Â° E)

I remember feeling excited when our flight landed in Incheon Airport. We stayed at a traditional hanok in Seoul. The host was delighful, making sure we were well fed each morning. On our final night she made us <i>tteokguk</i> (ë–¡êµ­), made of sliced rice cakes in a broth, which I savoured every bite of it. We visited Bukchon Hanok Village, and rented a bike and cycled along the Han River. The food we had in Seoul was the best - mandu, bibim naengmyeon, fried chicken with <i>makgeolli</i>, gingseng chicken...
