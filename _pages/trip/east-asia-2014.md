### Hong Kong (22.3193Â° N, 114.1694Â° E)

The second time I visited Hong Kong was with a group of friends in my mid-20s.
Hong Kong felt like an overwhelming concrete jungle of a city.
We had claypot rice, roast goose, milk tea.

### Seoul (37.5665Â° N, 126.9780Â° E)

I remember feeling excited when our flight landed in Incheon Airport.
We stayed at a hanok and the host was such a delight to have making us breakfast every morning.
On our final night she made us Tteokguk, a Korean rice cake dish, which I savoured every bite of it.
