### Morning

My weekdays are spent commuting to & from work. Due to my field of work, I am assigned a roster so the time I need to be in the office varies from day to day - 8:00, 9:00 or 10:00am. This means I need to adjust my routine slightly to account for the difference in time going to/from the office. 

Weekday:
- 5:30/6:30: Wake up, wash my face, make up, do my hair to get ready for work
  - Mornings are particularly hectic when I need to get to work by 8:00 or 9:00. I don't usually have time in the mornings to have breakfast so I go without. When I do get time, I tend to have a light breakfast usually yoghurt with granola. 
  - On days when I start work at 10:00, I have more time to spare and will have a proper breakfast and a coffee on the side.
- 6:30/7:30/8:30: Commuting to work by public transport (~1 hour)
- 8:00/9:00/10:00: At the office
- 11:00/12:00/1:00/2:00: Lunch time with 30 mins walking around the block
- 4:30/5:30/6:30: Home time - heading home by public transport (~1 hour)
- 6:00/7:30: Dinner time, wash the dishes, etc.
- 7:30/8:00: Shower, brush my teeth to get ready for bed (~30 mins to 1 hour)
- 8:30/9:00: Relaxing in bed with a book or watching videos on YouTube
- 9:30/10:30/11:00: Sleep time
