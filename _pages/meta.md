### Purpose

This website serves as public learning space for me to learn more about myself, how this fits in with what I already know, and what else there is for me to discover. I also like to record random tidbits of my life in the form of [[routines]], [[tools]] I use that shape my workflow. 

### History

<dl>

<dd> September. Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, invades England</dd>

<dd> October. William of Normandy defeats and kills Harold II at Hastings</dd>

<dt>1070</dt>
<dd> William the Conqueror subdues the north of England</dd>

<dd> First Norman stone castle is built in Wales</dd>

- Early 2021: Registered this website with [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) 
    - My intention was to create a personal website/digital repository. 
    - I heard of Gatsby, Jekyll and Eleventy, but felt intimidated by as my web development skills are limited to HTML and CSS. 
    - I have experience using Wordpress, so decided to use premade Wordpress templates and adapt them to work as a digital repository - this did not work as well as I exoected. 
      - Wordpress felt clunky, was slow to update, and is prone to malicious attacks.
- Long period of inactivity 
- November 2022: Revisited the concept of static website generators through Ness Lab's article on <a href="https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up">How to Set Up a Digital Garden</a>. 
- Now: Voila!

### Process

1. Install Ruby, Ruby on Gems, and Git on computer (slight learning curve ðŸ¥²)
2. Fork the template to Github account
3. Clone template to local server
4. Test, test, test!
5. Upload to Github 
6. Deploy to Netlify
7. Point DNS to Github (where the website is stored)
8. Update website using Visual Studio Code and Obsidian
9. Push changes to Github

The website is made up individual `.md` files that sit locally in my computer as folders. With the help of the following walkthroughs, I was able to install the template and get the website up and running. ðŸŽ‰
