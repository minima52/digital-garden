### About

This website serves as public learning space for me to learn more about myself, how this fits in with what I already know, and what else there is for me to discover. I also like to record random tidbits of my life in the form of [[routines]], [[tools]] I use that shape my workflow. 

### Timeline

### Process

1. Install Ruby, Ruby on Gems, and Git on computer (slight learning curve ðŸ¥²)
2. Fork the template to Github account
3. Clone template to local server
4. Test, test, test!
5. Upload to Github 
6. Deploy to Netlify
7. Point DNS to Github (where the website is stored)
8. Update website using Visual Studio Code and Obsidian
9. Push changes to Github

The website is made up individual `.md` files that sit locally in my computer as folders.

I was able to install the template and get the website up and running with the help of the following walkthroughs:
