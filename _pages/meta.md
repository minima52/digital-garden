### Purpose

This website serves as public learning space for me to learn more about myself, how this fits in with what I already know, and what else there is for me to discover. I also like to record random tidbits of my life in the form of [[routines]], [[tools]] I use that shape my workflow. 

### History

I registered this website in early 2021 and tried to adapt Wordpress templates as a digital repository, which felt like fitting a square in a circle. After a long period of inactivity and feeling guilty for leaving my website to collect dust, I revisited the concept of static website generators through Ness Lab's article on <a href="https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up">How to Set Up a Digital Garden</a>. Wordpress felt clunky, slow to update, and apparently, I heard it was prone to attacks. 

### Process

This website is built using individual pages that exist in folders on my PC. I have limited knowledge and skills in web development, but was able to get the install the template and get the website up and running using both these helpful walkthoughs: 

- [Setting up your own digital garden with Jekyll](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll)
- [Obsidian-Jekyll Walkthrough Guide](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow) (used VS Code instead of Atom)
