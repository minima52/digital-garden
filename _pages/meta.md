### Purpose

This website serves as public learning space for me to learn more about myself, how this fits in with what I already know, and what else there is for me to discover. I also like to record random tidbits of my life in the form of [[routines]], [[tools]] I use that shape my workflow. 

### History

I registered this website with [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) in early 2021 with the intention of creating a personal website/digital repository. At that time, I heard of Gatsby, Jekyll and Eleventy, but felt intimidated by as my web development skills are limited to HTML and CSS. I have experience using Wordpress, so decided to use premade Wordpress templates and adapt them to work as a digital repository - this did not work as well as I exoected. Wordpress felt clunky, was slow to update, and is prone to malicious attacks. Feeling hopeless, I went on a long period of inactivity until November 2022 when I revisited the concept of static website generators through Ness Lab's article on <a href="https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up">How to Set Up a Digital Garden</a>. And then...voila!

### Process

1. Install Ruby, Ruby on Gems, and Git on computer (slight learning curve ðŸ¥²)
2. Fork the template to Github account
3. Clone template to local server
4. Test, test, test!
5. Upload to Github 
6. Deploy to Netlify
7. Point DNS to Github (where the website is stored)
8. Update website using Visual Studio Code and Obsidian
9. Push changes to Github

The website is made up individual `.md` files that sit locally in my computer as folders. With the help of the following walkthroughs, I was able to install the template and get the website up and running. ðŸŽ‰
