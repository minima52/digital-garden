### Purpose

This website serves as public learning space for me to learn more about myself, how this fits in with what I already know, and what else there is for me to discover. I also like to record random tidbits of my life in the form of [[routines]], [[tools]] I use that shape my workflow. 

### History

I registered this website in early 2021 and tried to adapt Wordpress templates as a digital repository, which frustrated me as it did not work as well as I expected. After more than a year of inactivity and feeling guilty for leaving my website to collect dust, I came across the concept of static website generators as a simpler and more secure solution to Wordpress. This website is built using individual pages that exist in folders on my PC. I have limited knowledge and skills in web development, but was able to install Ruby scripts, install the Jekyll template, and deploy it onto Dreamhost, my web host. ðŸ™ƒ
