`/make up routine`

I apply make up every time I go to work, to meet up with friends when I head out, or at family functions and events. Otherwise, I'm barefaced most of the time. ðŸ‘¶ My make up routine tends to be simple with focus placed around the eyes. Usually it takes me 20 mins to apply my make up.
