<h1>Learning Log</h1>

Insights I have gained from my language learning journey are documented here. These are personalised, so what works or doesn't work for me, will be different for you.

<h2>Notetaking Methods</h2>

<ul>
<li>I now try to visualise my learning using <b>mindmaps</b> instead of a linear notetaking style. Writing pages and pages of notes feels like a passive exercise. My goal is to induce more active learning and to learn the concepts well enough that I can map it in a way my brain thinks and connects things in relation to each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Study Methods</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Physical flashcards</b> don't work for me. They take time to make, and I don't find them efficient at learning vocab, grammar, or other language concepts.</li>
</ul>
